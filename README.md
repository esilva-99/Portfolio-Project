This project is an exploratory analysis of vehicle recalls from 1966 to 2023. I obtained this dataset from Data.gov with the aim of providing insight into which automobile companies are the most and least reliable. By investigating which companies have the highest number of recalls, which parts they are recalling, and how recalls affect vehicle usability, I can assist potential buyers in making informed decisions about which companies are more reliable.

After exploring the data using SQL, I created a Tableau dashboard to present my findings. I designed the dashboard to help users learn more about recalls from selected manufacturers. The visualization displays which components were most frequently recalled, the percentage of recalls with a 'no drive advisory,' and how the number of recalls has changed over the years.
